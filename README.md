# Volunteer Coordinator Toolkit

A personal project, one of several I build to model real world job descriptions
and turn them into functional business utilities. The goal is to practice applied
problem solving on the kind of work a volunteer coordinator does, while
strengthening my foundational software development skills.

The repository holds three small browser tools written in plain HTML, CSS, and
vanilla JavaScript. Each one is self contained, rule based, and built around
clean business logic, careful input validation, and data integrity. There is no
AI, no machine learning, no framework, no build step, and no server. Every tool
opens by double-clicking its HTML file, and any file you load is read in the
browser and never sent anywhere.

## The three tools

1. **[Onboarding Eligibility Validator](01-onboarding-eligibility-validator/)**
   checks each volunteer's completed requirements and clears only those who are
   of age and have a passed and unexpired background check, every required
   training, and a signed unexpired waiver. It produces the cleared roster the
   planner uses.
2. **[Shift Coverage Planner](02-shift-coverage-planner/)** takes the shifts that
   need filling and the volunteers signed up for them, counts only cleared
   volunteers toward coverage, and flags understaffed and overstaffed shifts and
   any volunteer double-booked across overlapping shifts.
3. **[Volunteer Hours Dashboard](03-volunteer-hours-dashboard/)** loads a CSV of
   logged hours with the FileReader API and shows totals per volunteer, milestone
   flags, and anomalies such as overlapping or excessive entries.

## How they connect

The Onboarding Eligibility Validator is the gate the scheduling depends on. It
emits a cleared roster, `cleared_roster.json`, and the Shift Coverage Planner
ships that same file, byte for byte. Jordan Lee (V-105) is blocked at onboarding
for a missing background check, so he is `cleared: false` in that roster. When he
is the only volunteer signed up for a shift, the planner rejects his assignment
and leaves the shift understaffed. An uncleared volunteer cannot fill a shift,
and that worked example is documented in both tools' `spec.md`.

The Volunteer Hours Dashboard covers the separate job of tracking hours and
recognizing milestones. It uses the same cast of volunteers, and the volunteer
who was never cleared never appears in the clean hours.

## Running any tool

Open the tool's `index.html` in a web browser by double-clicking it. Nothing to
install. Each tool also has a `tests.html` that runs its logic against
hand-worked numbers and prints PASS or FAIL on the page, so the checks run with
no build tooling.

Each tool folder has its own README with worked examples and screenshots, a
`spec.md` describing purpose, inputs, validation, logic, outputs, and edge cases,
sample data, and a test page.

## How each tool is built

- Pure business logic lives in its own `.js` file, written as functions that take
  input and return values with no DOM access.
- A thin page script wires the form and the page to that logic.
- Durations are tracked in whole minutes and dates and times are written
  explicitly, dates as `YYYY-MM-DD` and times on a 24-hour clock, so output is
  never ambiguous and totals do not drift.

`FileReader` API and stay on your machine.
